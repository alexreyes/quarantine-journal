<h1>about</h1>

<br>
<p>Quarantine Notes is a project that was built for the Open Web Hackathon, hosted by <a href="https://www.arweave.org/" target="_blank">arweave</a>. The development of this project took place during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus" target="_blank">Coronavirus pandemic</a> in March 2020 and was built by <a href="https://www.alexreyes.xyz/" target="_blank">Alex Reyes.</a></p>

<p>The explicit aim of this project is to provide a way for people living during this time period to record notes/reflections/any text they would like future generations to be able to view from this historic time. </p>

<p>Since this project uses the arweave blockchain to store posts, all posts which are made on this site are public and viewable by anyone. They will be on the blockchain permanently or at least as long as the arweave project continues. </p>

<p>This project is free, and always will be. If you don’t already have an arweave wallet, you can claim one <a href="https://www.arweave.org/wallet" target="_blank"s>here.</a></p>

<p>P.S Quarantine Notes is <a href="https://github.com/alexreyes/perma-quarantine-notes-web">open source!</a></p>
